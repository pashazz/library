This project is intended to show Keycloak-based Spring Security configuration with ACLs.

The datasources for permissions and for books are different.

** Step 1. Tutorial

I started with this [[https://www.thomasvitale.com/spring-security-keycloak/][tutorial]].

It gives us a basic understanding of Spring Security RBAC with two roles: ~Member~ and ~Librarian~.


** TODO Step 2. RBAC -> ACL

Follow disussion at:

https://lists.jboss.org/pipermail/keycloak-user/2018-October/015882.html

And implement new id-based roles for books

** TODO Step 3. Permanent Books

Replace a datasource for books with a database

** TODO Step 4. Stress Test

Make a stress test for this thing. Possibly compare with casbin implementation if it will be there.
